Part 1 - Communication: You'll learn about Hall's high-context versus low-context communication and space concepts. Part 2 - Time: You'll explore monochronic versus polychronic time orientations. By the end, you'll understand why your 'perfectly clear' email confuses some colleagues, why 'urgent' means different things to different people, and how to synchronize action across these fundamental differences.",getNextChunk,1,"Workplace Success","Cultural Intelligence","Being In-Sync"
