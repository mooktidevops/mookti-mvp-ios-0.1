These core concepts are cultural intelligence (the ability to function effectively in culturally-diverse environments), emotional intelligence (the ability to recognize emotions in others and manage them in ourselves), and communication (the mutual sharing and receiving of meaning we use to understand one another and get things done), which we will cover in that order.",getNextChunk,1,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"

Culture here might refer to the culture of a nation or religion, but it works just as well in the context of workplaces and teams. CQ is a multifaceted concept, with cognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions.

14,aporia-system,"Why start with Cultural Intelligence (CQ)? There's a Ph.D.-level explanation why, but it might be easier to walk you through an example of a big, real-world problem in a working relationship that shows just how powerful CQ can be, rather than waiting for you to finish your doctoral dissertation.

14.2.1,aporia-system,"Communication is the most straightforward of the three topics we'll be covering, but successful communication depends in large part on high levels of both CQ and EQ. Both are important to cover, but our experts feel CQ should take precedence because of the relationship between CQ and EQ themselves: while both are forms of social intelligence, the expression—and therefore legibility—of emotion varies depending on cultural context. This means that first giving you the tools to discern cultural variance in emotions and behavior seems a natural choice. As Earley and Ang write in their influential 2003 work, 'When people interact with others from different cultural backgrounds, many, if not most, of the common cues for understanding and predicting the other's moods, emotions, and intent are unavailable or easily misattributed. However, some individuals [i.e. those with high CQ] are able to quickly integrate themselves into social gatherings, command effective action from work units, and so forth, whereas others [with low CQ] are quite ineffective' (Earley and Ang 2003, 12).

15,system,"So here's the scenario: It's April 2001. In the contested region of the South China Sea, an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet have collided mid-air, resulting in the death of the Chinese pilot. Both countries release different accounts of the events that led to the crash: the PRC claims that the American plane performed a sudden, unexpected banking maneuver into the Chinese jet, while the American government states the jet's pilot was at fault. The Chinese pilot flew dangerously close to the spy plane, the Americans claim, and had a history of other dangerous maneuvers in previous encounters with American military aircraft. It's a major international incident ${ON HOVER: 'And a real one! Though it was soon overshadowed by the events of September 11, 2001 half a year later.'}, with stakes defined in human lives: after the collision, the American spy plane was forced to perform an emergency landing on a Chinese island, and the crew of 24 have been detained. China has stated they are being held so that an investigation can be conducted, while an American senator has (provocatively) claimed that they are being held hostage. The PRC demands an apology from the American government, while the USA refuses to do so. What should be done to peacefully resolve the incident?",getNextAporia-User,15.1 | 15.2 | 15.3,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"

15.1.1,aporia-system,"That's a good instinct! However, the two sides have already been talking—that's kind of the problem. Saying the right thing seems to be the way to defuse the situation: China isn't demanding compensation or any other form of redress other than an apology. Yet neither government is willing to admit fault. What else can we do?",getNextAporia-User,15.1.1.1 | 15.1.1.2,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"
15.2.1,aporia-system,"That's a good instinct! The facts of the incident are key to the conflict here, with both sides maintaining different versions of events. Investigations of plane crashes can take years, however, and we need a quicker solution than an investigation can provide: remember that the Americans are extremely concerned about the 24 crew members currently detained by the Chinese. What's our next step?",getNextAporia-User,15.1 | 15.3 | 15.1.1.1.1.2,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"
15.3.1,aporia-system,"That's a great question! It might not be obvious at first, but the scenario actually mirrors some kinds of conflict we see in workplaces everyday. The stakes obviously aren't as high when the disagreement is between two employees about who should have priority at the printer, or within a team about the division of responsibilities. But if we boil things down, our example involves two parties at odds with one another who both have a mutual interest in moving forward but, for reasons that aren't clear yet, can't figure out how to do so—just like Bob and Steve disagree about the printer, but have a strong mutual interest in sorting things through quickly so they can get back to work. So what do we do for the US and China and their higher stakes conflict?",getNextAporia-User,15.1 | 15.2,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"

15.1.1.1.1,aporia-system,"You're right that meeting face to face offers some key advantages to long-distance communication: in-person, we're able to read the emotions of those we're talking to much more easily than we can via writing or call. However, leaving aside the dynamics of international diplomacy—diplomats have orders from their bosses, so two diplomats connecting on a personal level probably can't diffuse the problem at hand, as those bosses won't feel any closer together after the diplomats having a couple of beers—let's say that American and Chinese diplomats have met in person. The meetings have been tense, with both sides displaying signs of anger and frustration.

15.1.1.1.1.1.1,aporia-system,"Great questions, and great CQ! It is possible to misinterpret emotional signals in cross-cultural contacts—resolving those misunderstandings is part of what CQ is all about—but let's say for the sake of argument here that emotions are being read correctly on all sides.",getNextAporia-User,15.1.1.1.1.2 | 15.1.1.1.1.3,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"
16,system,"OK, now we're getting somewhere. In this scenario, we don't have the luxury of a thorough, fact-based investigation to help us determine which party was at fault. In a high-stakes situation like this, we can safely assume that both the PRC and the USA are deploying their best communicators, but still can't get on the same page. At the same time, because those communicators are representing national rather than personal interests, individual expressions of emotion probably won't show us a path forward.",getNextChunk,17,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"
17,system,"In summary, then, we don't have the time to arrive at an objective determination of fault. Options for improved communication and emotional intelligence are limited, so we're left with...some third thing. It's here that we discover the importance of Cultural Intelligence for solving the problem at hand. The motivations of both the Americans and the Chinese are shaped not only by their relative position in world affairs [ON HOVER: Remember that our scenario plays out in early 2001, before China joined the United States as the world's leading superpowers.], but by the values of their cultures.",getNextAporia-System,18,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"

18.2.1,system,"You're definitely right that the cultures of both countries are diverse. In fact, experts will tell us that no culture is unitary, especially when we're talking about culture on the national level. At the same time, however, studies in many, many academic fields repeatedly show us that, from a high enough level, cultures do differ from one another. The proof, then, is in the pudding: in this case, we see distinctly different motivations emerge between the PRC and the USA that reveal different cultural values at work.",getNextChunk,18.2.2,"Workplace Success","Introduction","Introduction to Workplace Success"

21,system,"Well, with these understandings in mind, we now know all that we need to to find a solution to this difficult situation—just like the PRC and the USA found the real solution to this dispute in 2001. The Americans were able to craft a statement that, to Americans, offered condolences without a clear admission of fault—which avoided American anxieties about appearing weak—but which was sufficiently apologetic to the Chinese to restore their face.
